# Midfielder Similarity Explorer

A data-driven project to analyse and visualise midfielder performance in Europeâ€™s top football leagues. This project combines statistical analysis, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and an interactive Streamlit app to explore player similarities and playing styles.
Interactive app link: [Midfielder Similarity App](https://midfielder-similarity.streamlit.app/)

## Project Overview

This project aims to:

* Collect and merge detailed midfielder statistics from multiple sources (fbref tables).
* Explore relationships between metrics and reduce dimensionality using PCA.
* Compute player similarity using distances derived from PCA projections.
* Visualise player similarities with Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and highlight clusters using K-means.
* Provide an interactive interface through a Streamlit app to search for similar players, view clusters, and compare percentile metrics.

## Data

* Raw data is sourced from [fbref](https://fbref.com/) tables for midfielders in top European leagues.
* The processed dataset (`mids_selected.csv`) contains cleaned, normalised per-90 statistics for each player, ready for analysis and use in the Streamlit app.

## Analysis

* **Correlation Analysis:** Explore relationships between features to identify redundancies and patterns.
* **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** Reduce dimensionality and identify the main axes of variation.
* **MDS (Multidimensional Scaling):** Project players into 2D space based on Euclidean and cosine distances from PCA projections.
* **K-Means Clustering:** Group players into 4 clusters representing distinct midfielder archetypes.

## Streamlit App

The interactive app allows users to:

* Select a player and see the 8 most similar midfielders.
* Toggle between Euclidean and cosine distances to explore different similarity perspectives.
* Visualise players on MDS plots colored by cluster.
* Compare players using radar charts and percentile metrics across shooting, passing, progression, creativity, defending, and errors.

To run the app:

```bash
streamlit run mids_app.py
```

## Key Insights

* PCA and correlation analysis reveal patterns and redundancies in midfielder statistics.
* Euclidean MDS highlights players with similar raw output; cosine MDS highlights players performing similar roles with differing efficiency.
* K-means clusters correspond to intuitive midfielder archetypes such as playmakers, progressive carriers, and defensive midfielders.
* The Streamlit app provides a practical interface to explore these relationships interactively.
